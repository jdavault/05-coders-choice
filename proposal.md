## Proposed Project

I want to take elements from the Hangman project (supervisors and worker processes) and from the Notes lecture and create a Phoenix "MVC" version of the hangmen using routes, controllers, view, partials.  Instead of having a dictiony on the file system, i will store it in a Postgres database so I an play with the Postgrex adapter.


## Outline Structure

Three teirs -- web, model (business logic) and repo.  Similar to what had in the hangman, I will have the model under supervision. I'm thinking it makes sense to separate out the model and repo and supervis both but I need to play with that and think through it.
